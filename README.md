# Wikipedia quiz

This project is day #9 of <a href="https://github.com/grigoryan-m/100-day-javascript.git">100-day-javascript</a>!

Using wikipedia API to get an article text and title.

User can change article length (from 200 to 500). 

This quiz is almost impossible without googling. It's not meant for playing, just for practising my JS skills, but you can try :)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Hotkey</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enter</td>
    <td>Submit answer</td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can submit empty string to skip the article.

All the articles are from english wiki, but i am planning to add language choosing later.

If you loose, game will show you correct answer.

Input has an article title as [*] symbols, so you always know how many words are in the title and how many symbols are in each word.

Hope you have fun playing, but I guess you will just suffer.
